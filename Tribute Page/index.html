      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1995 - october 5, 2011) was an American
        entrepreneur, industrial designer, business magnate, media proprietor,
        and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman & CEO of Apple, the
        chairman & majority shareholder of Pixer, a member of the Walt Disney
        company's bord of directors following it's acquisition of Pixwe, and the
        founder, chairman, and CEO of Next. He is widely recognized as a pioneer
        of personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his
        early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

        In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the
        company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs
        took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform
        development company that specialized in computers for higher-education
        and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he helped develop the
        visual effects industry by funding the computer graphics division of
        Lucasfilm that eventually spun off independently as Pixar, which
        produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995)
        and became a leading animation studio, producing over 27 films since.

        Around that time, Wozniak designed a low-cost digital "blue box" to
        generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network,
        allowing free long-distance calls. He was inspired by an article titled
        "Secrets of the Little Blue Box" from the October 1971 issue of Esquire.
        Jobs decided then to sell them and split the profit with Wozniak. The
        clandestine sales of the illegal blue boxes went well and perhaps
        planted the seed in Jobs's mind that electronics could be both fun and
        profitable. In a 1994 interview, he recalled that it took six months for
        him and Wozniak to design the blue boxes. Jobs later reflected that had
        it not been for Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an
        Apple".
